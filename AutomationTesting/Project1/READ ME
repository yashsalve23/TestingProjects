## Project Overview

This project includes automated test scripts to verify various functionalities of the CURA Healthcare Service website. The tests are written in Java using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG, following best practices in test automation.

### Key Features

- **Automated Test Scripts**: The test scripts cover various scenarios including login, appointment scheduling, and more.
- **Test Data Management**: Test data is stored in the `src/test/resources/test-data` directory.
- **Test Reports**: Generated test reports are available in the `test-reports` directory.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **TestNG**: For running and managing test cases.
- **Maven**: For project management and build automation.
- **Allure**: For generating test reports.

### Configuration

- **Browser Configuration**: Update the browser settings in the `src/test/resources/config.properties` file as needed.
- **Test Data**: Update the test data files in the `src/test/resources/test-data` directory for different test scenarios.

## Test Report

A detailed test report is generated after each test run. You can find the report in the `test-reports` directory. The report provides insights into the test execution, including passed and failed tests, and other relevant details.
