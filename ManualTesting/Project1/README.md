# Project Title: Comprehensive Manual Testing

## Project Description

This project showcases a comprehensive manual testing process performed on the web application hosted at [AwesomeQA](https://awesomeqa.com/ui/). The goal was to ensure the quality and functionality of the application through full regression testing. This repository contains all the necessary documentation and reports generated during the testing lifecycle.

## Repository Structure

- **Test SRS (Software Requirements Specification)**: This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the AwesomeQA application. It serves as a foundation for the test cases and helps in understanding the expected behavior of the system.
- **Test Plan**: The test plan provides a detailed roadmap of the testing activities. It includes the testing scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and deliverables.
- **Test Cases**: This section contains detailed test cases created based on the SRS for the AwesomeQA application. Each test case includes the test steps, expected results, and actual results.
- **Test Environment**: This document describes the hardware and software environment in which the testing was conducted. It includes information on the operating system, browsers, and any other tools used.
- **Test Strategy**: The test strategy outlines the overall approach and methodology adopted for the testing process. It includes the types of testing performed, tools used, and risk management.
- **Bug Report**: This section contains detailed bug reports for all the defects identified during testing. Each report includes the bug ID, description, severity, steps to reproduce, and status.
- **Test Execution Report**: The test execution report provides a summary of the test execution activities, including the number of test cases executed, passed, failed, and any defects identified.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To understand and utilize the documents in this repository, you should have a basic knowledge of manual testing concepts and familiarity with the software development life cycle (SDLC) and software testing life cycle (STLC).

### How to Use the Documents

1. **Review the Test SRS**: Start by understanding the requirements of the AwesomeQA application through the SRS document.
2. **Understand the Test Plan**: Go through the test plan to get an overview of the testing activities, schedule, and resources.
3. **Study the Test Strategy**: Review the test strategy to understand the approach and methodologies used for testing.
4. **Set Up the Test Environment**: Follow the instructions in the test environment document to replicate the testing setup.
5. **Execute the Test Cases**: Use the test cases to perform the testing activities. Record the actual results and compare them with the expected results.
6. **Report Bugs**: Document any defects found during testing in the bug report section.
7. **Analyze the Test Execution Report**: Review the test execution report to understand the testing outcomes and any remaining issues.
